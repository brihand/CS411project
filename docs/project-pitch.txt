***First idea:

This app puts a creative spin on financial advisory. It will use regional data from Spotify on and around Wall St. 
(or across any financial districts) to determine the most-listened to songs. 
It will perform sentiment analysis on the songs by extracting their genres and key words from the lyrics. 
In addition, it will extract keywords from top tweets that day, perhaps from top financial gurus or CEOs. 
It will correlate these genres and lyrics with moods and will then recommend a certain stock action (i.e. buying or selling a certain stock). 

Pseudo quant software

**Second idea: 

Student inputs location and app returns recommended places to eat based on bus schedule and “what’s open” (API from BU Dining)

This app recommends BU students nearby on-campus places to eat, using BU bus schedules and a list of open BU dining facilities. 
After the user logs in using his or her BU ID, it will take the user’s location and recommend the quickest BU bus routes to nearest 
BU dining facilities that are open based on the BU Dining API “What’s Open.”

*Third idea:

Students input account information for his amazon, walmart, farfetch account(all in one account).

This app grabs all those shopify websites’ order status info together: make it convenient for students to see everything on one platform.
Receiving all updated order status information from those shopify websites makes it clear for users.
